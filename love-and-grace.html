    <h1>Love and Grace</h1>
    <h2>Ephesians 2:8</h2>
    <p><b>Verse:</b> For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.</p>
    <p><b>Interpretation:</b> God's love and grace are freely given, not earned. We are saved by His unmerited favor, a gift for all who believe.</p>
    <h2>1 John 4:9-10</h2>
    <p><b>Verse:</b> This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.</p>
    <p><b>Interpretation:</b> True love is demonstrated by God’s sacrifice for us. His grace covers all our shortcomings.</p>
