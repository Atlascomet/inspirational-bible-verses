    <h1>Strength and Courage</h1>
    <p><b>Joshua 1:9</b> "Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go".</p>
    <p><b>Interpretation:</b> God gives us strength and courage for every challenge. We are never alone; His presence gives us boldness.</p>
	<br>
    <p><b>Isaiah 40:31</b> "But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be 
	faint.</p>
    <p><b>Interpretation:</b> Waiting on God renews our strength and enables us to persevere and rise above challenges.</p>
	<br>
    <p><b>Corinthians 12:9-10</b> "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.' Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my 
	weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I 
	am weak, then I am strong."</p>
	<p><b>Interpretation:<p></b> 
	<p><b>"My grace is sufficient for you"</p></b>
    Grace is God's unmerited favor, power, and sustaining presence. The word "sufficient" means that Christ's help is completely adequate to maintain Paul (and by extension, any believer)
	through any trial. God assures Paul that he doesn't need the "thorn" removed to endure; he has everything he needs in God's freely given, powerful grace.</p>
<p><b>
"For my power is made perfect in weakness"</p></b>
This is the core of the paradox. God's divine power (dynamis, often translated as miraculous power) is fully revealed or made complete when human strength is at its lowest.</p>

When Paul is strong in his own ability or self-reliance, his successes look like his achievements.

When he is weak, suffering, or overwhelmed, any accomplishment or endurance is clearly God's power at work, leaving no doubt about the source of the strength. The weakness becomes the 
stage for God's power to be perfectly demonstrated.

<p><b>Boasting in Weaknesses, Insults, and Hardships</p></b>
Because Paul understands this principle, he radically re-evaluates his hardships. Instead of hiding his struggles, he chooses to boast (or glory) in them.</p>

<p><b>Motivation:</b> He welcomes these difficult circumstances—weaknesses, insults, persecutions—because they provide the very conditions necessary for Christ's power to "rest on" 
him (a word that can mean "to tabernacle" or dwell upon).</p>

<p><b>Result:</b> By embracing his own frailty, he creates a space for Christ's presence and power to become his functional strength.</p>

<p><b>"For when I am weak, then I am strong"</p></b>
This is the ultimate summary of the paradox.</p>

<p><b>Weak (Humanly):</b> When Paul is limited, suffering, and dependent on God, he feels the full weight of his human inability.</p>

<p><b>Strong (Divinely):</b> It is precisely in this state of helplessness that he is filled with and empowered by the full, perfecting strength of Christ. His personal weakness is 
exchanged for Christ's limitless power.</p>

<p>In essence, the verse teaches that a follower of Christ should not seek to overcome hardship in their own power, but rather to rely entirely on God's grace in the midst of it, 
knowing that weakness is the perfect vehicle for the display of God's glory and power.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Psalm 28:7</b> "The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and he helps me. My heart leaps for joy, and with my song I praise him"</p></b>
<p><b>Nehemiah 8:10</b> "Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.</p>
<p><b>Exodus 15:2 </b> "The Lord is my strength and my defense; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him"</p>
<p><b>Isaiah 41:10</b> "So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand"</p>
